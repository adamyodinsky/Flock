## Who are your target customers or users?

Businesses that want to utilize Ai in their business.


## Who are your main competitors?

- SuperAGI: https://superagi.com/

useful autonomous agents quickly & reliably.

- https://www.cognosys.ai/
web-based AI agent designed to revolutionize productivity and simplify complex tasks. Elevate your everyday life with the most advanced AI technology available.

## What is your unique value proposition that sets you apart from these competitors?

1. We are building for scale, and focusing more on B2B than B2C. meaning organizations can really utilize the platform in which scale they want effortlessly, while the competitors are more focused on B2C.
2. We are building for maximum customer flexibility, privacy and control. while some of the major competitors are less flexible, less privacy focused.
3. A bunch of our features are unique to us, such as the Ai tools creation platform, and the task management system. there are no competitors that offer such features.

Overall, we are building a platform that is easy to use, flexible, privacy focused, and scalable. that can be used by any business to utilize Ai in their business.

While our competitors are more focused on B2C, less flexible, less privacy focused, and less scalable. which will make it hard for businesses to utilize their platforms, if at all.


## Could you provide some details about your business model? (how will you make money?)

Subscription-based + Pay-as-you-go/Usage-based model: Businesses can use the platform only with annual/monthly subscription basic fee + pay for exactly what they use. The more they use the AI tools or task management system, the more they pay. This model would attract smaller businesses that have varying needs.

The annual/monthly will include "vouchers" that can be used for the pay-as-you-go/usage-based model. The vouchers will be used to pay for the usage of the AI tools or task management system. The vouchers will be renewed every month/year, depending on the subscription model. when exhausted, the business will be charged for the usage of the AI tools or task management system as they use it.

## What is the current stage of your startup? (Idea, Prototype, Launched, Revenue Generating, etc.)

A well built Prototype, with strong foundations. and a strong vision for the future.
still in the shades, not launched yet, or exposed in any way.

## Can you give a brief overview of your team (Founders and key employees)?

- Adam Yodinsky: The founder, i'm have a professional experience as a Devops, SRE, and Platform engineering. i'm also a backend developer in my spear time, a huge Ai space enthusiast, and a generally a tech geek.

- Yossi Shemesh: A professional super talented Frontend developer, and a user experience expert.

- Ugo Bokovza: A professional super talented Backend developer, and a data engineer.

## What is your marketing/Go-to-market strategy?

We will need to start with direct sales and partnerships, and then move to more scalable marketing strategies such as content marketing, SEO, and paid ads.

## Do you have any traction or key milestones to showcase?

We have a well built prototype, with strong foundations. and a strong vision for the future.

## What is your financial projection for the next 3-5 years?

### Costs

The cloud costs of the product are planned to be lower relative to the industry, as we are not planning to run this as a Sass, which will reduce cloud costs radically. most of the load will run on the client side, and the cloud will be used only for licensing authentication and authorization, and some other minor tasks to enable the product to work.

We need more people for the first stage but not a lot.

We can use another backend/data engineer, an ML, MLops engineer, and another SRE/Devops engineer. and actually more than this will be too uch for the first stage.

So will be overall a team of 5 people.

- 2 Backend/Data Engineer/MLops Engineer (One of them is Ugo, and another one to hire)
- Backend/Devops/SRE/MLops/Platform Engineer (Adam)
- Frontend Developer (Yossi)

## Revenue

I don't have a clear idea about the revenue. how much we will charge?

i think the main driver will be the pay as you go model, and the subscription will be a minor part of the revenue. if the user don't use my system, i don't want to charge him that much, so we have a drive to make the user use the system as much as possible, and make it worth while for him to pay for it.

If using our system, for task handling, and Ai tools platform is increasing the revenue of the business, the productivity, and reducing the costs, then how much can we charge for it? i guess it depends on the business, and how much value it's getting from the system, and on the scale, that's why On-The Go model is the main driver for the revenue.

If it increase he's revenue by 10% or more, for a company with 100 million dollars revenue, that's 10 million dollars, and we can charge 1 million dollars for it, and it will still be worth it for the business to use it. Now, we won't charge million dollars for it, but it goes to say that we can charge a lot of money for it, as long as we give a lot of value to the customer.

and in the initial stages, we can charge less, just to cover expenses, to gather as much users as possible.


And think of it that our agents can replace workers that are doing the same job, and they can do it better, faster, and cheaper.
And the other Ai tools can save a lot of money and increase productivity as well.

In the bottom line this platform manifested vision is the wet dream of every business owner, and it's worth a lot of money for them.


## How much funding are you seeking and what will you use it for?

Something around 2 million dollars, to hire more people, and to pay for the cloud costs, and other costs. for running the business for a year. and get to the point where we have growing users and a growing revenue.

## Any exit plan or long-term vision you'd like to share?

If things go well as expected, we will not need to exit, and we will be able to run the business for a long time, and make a lot of money. In more advanced stages we are aiming for a low cost, high revenue business model, that can run for a long time, and make a lot of money.

This why the business model is subscription based + pay as you go model.
this is why most of the cloud load will be on the user side, which also give increased privacy for the client and flexibility. this is why we are building for scale, and focusing more on B2B than B2C.

Startups can rise and fall only on their cloud costs, as a DevOps i know this very well, and i'm building the system with this in mind.
Also architecture wise, every line of code that was written thus far was written with this in mind. every line is a stone in a well built foundation, that can we easily keep building upon, and scale.

This configuration file:

Enables journaling for data durability.
Configures logging to a file.
Binds MongoDB to all available IPs (0.0.0.0) and enables SSL/TLS.
Sets the paths to the certificate files (these files should be created in the mongodb_cert folder).
Enables authentication.
For SSL/TLS, you need to create a mongodb_cert directory and generate the required certificates. You can use OpenSSL or another tool to generate a self-signed certificate, or use a certificate issued by a trusted Certificate Authority (CA). Make sure to place the generated mongodb.pem and mongodb-ca.pem files in the mongodb_cert directory.

Now, you can start the MongoDB container using:

```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

To connect to the MongoDB container securely, use the following connection string:

```bash
mongodb://root:your_password@localhost:27017/?ssl=true&sslCertificateAuthorityFile=mongodb-ca.pem&sslClientCertificateFile=mongodb.pem&authSource=admin
```

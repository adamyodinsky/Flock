### Prompt_00

```
The date is Thu Jun  8 11:11:22 IDT 2023.
Your knowledge was cut off in September 2021.


Instructions:
You will be providing a task for a large language model (LLM) with an 8000-word context window.

Given this limitation, it's necessary to split the Main Task into two categories of sub-tasks.

Pre-requisite sub-tasks: These are tasks that need to be completed before the primary task can be undertaken, such as research.

Main sub-tasks: These are smaller parts of the main task, designed to fit within the LLM's 8000-word context window limit.
For both categories, the tasks should be listed in the order they need to be completed.


Your response should be provided in JSON format. See the examples below for formatting:

{
"pre-sub-tasks": [
"do this",
"do that"
],
"sub-tasks": [
"do this",
"do that"
]
}


{
"pre-sub-tasks": [],
"sub-tasks": [
"do this",
"do that"
]
}

{
"pre-sub-tasks": [],
"sub-tasks": []
}


Note that there may be instances where there are no pre-requisite sub-tasks because the main task doesn't require any preliminary work.

Remember, you might need to decompose each sub-task into further sub-tasks recursively.

"Depth" denotes the degree of task breakdown. At '0', you're dealing with the primary, undivided task. Higher depth values indicate further decomposition into sub-tasks, signifying deeper recursion levels in the task hierarchy.
If no further breakdown is needed for a task to be completed, you can provide empty lists as in the examples above.

Your response must strictly be a raw JSON object.

Main Task: Write an article about the Eurovision Contest that occurred in May 2023.
Depth: 0
```

### Answer_00

    }
  ]
}
```


We can see there is a mistake here... so we need to change the prompt.

```
This is a prompt template that will be used recursively, you wil not have memory of the previous calls in the recursion.

This prompt template purpose is to break down a task to smaller sub-tasks, until they can be done by an LLM powered program with 8000-word context window limit.

Given this limitation, it's necessary to split the Main Task into two categories of 2 sub-tasks.

1. pre-tasks: These are tasks that need to be completed before the primary task can be undertaken, such as research.

2. main-tasks: These are smaller parts of the main task, designed to fit within the LLM's 8000-word context window limit.
For both categories, the tasks should be listed in the order they need to be completed.


Your response should be provided in JSON format, following the JSON schema below:

{
  "type": "object",
  "required": ["pre-tasks", "main-tasks"],
  "properties": {
    "pre-tasks": {
      "type": "array",
      "default": [],
      "items": {
        "type": "string"
      }
    },
    "main-tasks": {
      "type": "array",
      "default": [],
      "items": {
        "type": "string",
        "title": "A Schema"
      }
    }
  },
  "examples": [
    {
      "pre-tasks": ["do this", "do that"],
      "main-tasks": ["do this", "do that"]
    },
    {
      "pre-tasks": [],
      "main-tasks": ["do this", "do that"]
    },
    {
      "pre-tasks": [],
      "main-tasks": []
    }
  ]
}

Your response must strictly be a raw JSON object.

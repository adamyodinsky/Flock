To implement user logic with authentication and payment functionality, you can use a combination of authentication services and payment platforms. Here's a simple solution using Firebase Authentication and Stripe Billing:

Firebase Authentication: Firebase Authentication provides an easy-to-use and secure user authentication system. It supports various authentication methods, including email/password, social media logins, and Single Sign-On (SSO) providers. You can easily integrate Firebase Authentication into your app by following the official documentation: https://firebase.google.com/docs/auth

Stripe Billing: As discussed earlier, Stripe Billing is a powerful payment and subscription management platform. You can create different subscription plans and manage payments through Stripe's API and Dashboard.

Here's a high-level implementation outline:

Integrate Firebase Authentication into your app for user registration and login. When a user registers, create a new user entry in your Firebase Realtime Database or Firestore.

Set up your subscription plans in Stripe Billing, and create corresponding plans in your Firebase Realtime Database or Firestore. You can associate these plans with features or access levels in your app.

When a user wants to subscribe to a plan, redirect them to a payment page generated by Stripe Checkout or create a custom payment form using Stripe.js. Upon successful payment, Stripe will generate a webhook event.

Set up a webhook listener in your backend to receive and process events from Stripe. When you receive an event for successful payment or subscription, update the user's access level or plan in your Firebase Realtime Database or Firestore accordingly.

In your app, implement logic to check the user's subscription status or access level before allowing them to access specific features or content. You can do this by querying the user's entry in your Firebase Realtime Database or Firestore.

(Optional) You can also use Firebase Cloud Functions to automate some of the backend processes, like updating user data and handling webhook events from Stripe.

This solution enables you to easily implement user authentication, subscription, and payment functionality without the need to build complex logic or handle sensitive payment data yourself.
